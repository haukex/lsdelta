LSDelta - Least Significant Digit Delta
=======================================

This is pretty simplistic; it's more of a practice/test project.

See `c_gmp/lsdelta.h` for documentation of the pure C version.
It can be built with its `Makefile`.

To run the main tests (`make` in the main directory),
you first need to install the Python/C implementation
in `py_c`; see its `Makefile`.

Some benchmark results are at the end of `tests/test_lsdelta.py`.

TODO: Could write more tests in `lsdelta_tests.json`.
